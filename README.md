# ![python-icon](media/icons/python-icon.svg) Python

Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.[27] In July 2018, Van Rossum stepped down as the leader in the language community after 30 years.

Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython), the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's other implementations. Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit [Python Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation).
