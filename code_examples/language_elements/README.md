The **examples** in this folder show the use of Python basic elments and their meaning. 

## Collections 

Python programming language contains four collection data types in the 

1. **List** is a collection which is **ordered** and **changeable**. Allows **duplicate members**.
1. **Tuple** is a collection which is **ordered** and **unchangeable**. Allows **duplicate members**.
1. **Set** is a collection which is **unordered**, **unchangeable**, and **unindexed**. **No duplicate members**.
1. Dictionary is a collection which is **ordered** and **changeable**. **No duplicate members**.

    |Collection|Ordered|Changeable|Duplicates|Indexed|
    |----------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
    | List     | Yes   | Yes      | Yes      | Yes   |
    | Tuple    | Yes   | No       | Yes      | Yes   |
    | Set      | No    | No       | No       | No    |
    |Dictionary| Yes   | Yes      | No       | Yes   |

When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type.
Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean
retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.

> [!NOTE]
> Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
> As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
