The landing page for your documentation is your project's top-level
<modulename>/__init__.py file. Adding a module-level docstring here is a great
way to introduce users to your project. For example, the documentation you are
reading right now is sourced from pdoc/__init__.py. You can also include your
title page from a Markdown file.
