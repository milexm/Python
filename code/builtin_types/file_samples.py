Remarks
------

A file is a named location on disk to permanently store data in a non-volatile
memory (e.g. hard disk).  To read from or write to a file we need to open it
first. When done, it must be closed, so that resources that are tied with the
file are freed. The following are the 

The next examples cover common idioms for working with different kinds of files,
including text and binary files, file encodings, and other related matters.
Techniques for manipulating filenames and directories are also covered.  For
more information, see [IO - Core tools for working with
streams](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#module-io),

        Hash functions take an arbitrary amount of data and return a

        Hash is used in cryptography for authentication purposes.  Many hashing
        functions exist such as: MD5, SHA-1 etc. For more information, see [Hash
        functions in
        cryptography]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function).

        The following code illustrates how to hash a file. It uses the SHA-1
        hashing algorithm. The digest of SHA-1 is 160 bits long. 
        
        The file data is not processed all at once, because some files are very
        large to fit in memory. Breaking the file into small chunks will make
        the process memory efficient.

        If you need to add image processing features to your app, you can use
        sveral popular libraries such as: *OpenCV*, *scikit-image*, *Python
        Imaging Library* and **Pillow**.  The following example use Pillow, a
        library that is powerful, provides a wide array of image processing
        features, and is simple to use.  For more information, see [Image

        Adds a row to a csv file. The function first checks if the row already
        exists in the csv file and only adds the row if it does not exist.  The
        function asks the user how many columns to write for each row.  It loops
        asking for a new row as long as the user wishes to continue.  Prints the

        REMARKS
        -------
        CSV (comma-separated values) is a standard format for exporting and
        importing data. It allows you to store numbers and text in plain text.
        Each row of the file is a data record and every record consists of one
        or more fields (columns) separated by commas. Python has native support
        for CSV files. It contains a **csv module** which holds everything you
        need to make a CSV reader/writer, and it follows [RFC
        4180](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt) standards.  For mor
        information, see [csv â€” CSV File Reading and
        Writing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv).  See
