Module errors.py

Remarks
-------
In Python, all exceptions must be instances of a class that derives from
`BaseException`. 
The built-in exceptions can be generated by the interpreter or
built-in functions. Except where mentioned, they have an “associated value”
indicating the detailed cause of the error. This may be a string or a tuple of
several items of information (e.g., an error code and a string explaining the
code). The associated value is usually passed as arguments to the exception
class’s constructor. For more information, see [Built-in Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#built-in-exceptions).

        Issues a TypeError exception.
        
        Remarks
        -------

        Python has different types. In this example, the value assigned to `a`
        is of string type (i.e., text) while the value of `b` is an integer
        (i.e., whole number),

        You cannot add strings with integers, otherwise you get the following
        error: `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str`.
        
        Therefore, you need to convert the string to an integer using the
        `int()` built-in function. The correct statement is `print(int(a) + b)`.

        Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of
        inappropriate type. The associated value is a string giving details
        about the type mismatch.

        This exception may be raised by user code to indicate that an attempted
        operation on an object is not supported, and is not meant to be.  For
        more information, see [exception
        TypeError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError).

        Remarks
        -------

        In this exampe you get the error that `math` is not defined, that means
        math is not in the default namespace. You could easily find out that
        `math` is a module, so you simply need to do `import math`.  

        The exception `NameError` is raised when a local or global name is not
        found. This applies only to unqualified names. The associated value is
        an error message that includes the name that could not be found.

        The name attribute can be set using a keyword-only argument to the
        constructor. When set it represent the name of the variable that was
        attempted to be accessed. For more information, see [exception
        `NameError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#NameError).

        Remarks
        -------

        This example uses the incorrect attribute 'cosine'; it should be `cos`
        instead.  To find the correct attribute in a terminal do the following:
      
        1. activate `python`.
        1. \>>> import math
        1. \>>> dir(math) 
        1. \>>> help(math.cos)  

        Raised when an attribute reference (see Attribute references) or
        assignment fails. (When an object does not support attribute references
        or attribute assignments at all, TypeError is raised.)
