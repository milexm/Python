# ![python-icon](../media/icons/python-icon.svg) API reference documentation

The examples API reference documentation is created automatically from the
**docstrings** contained in the code.  

The following is the command used to generate the API documentation, executed
from the directory: `<user path>\<python project>`:

```cmd
    pdoc --force --html .\code --output .\reference\
```

> [!NOTE] This README file is the landing page of the API reference
documentation because it is included by the `code/__init__.py` This is
why:
>
> The landing page for the documentation is the project's top-level
> `<modulename>/__init__.py` file that in our case is `code/__init__.py`
> Adding a module-level docstring here is a great way to introduce users to
> the project. 

You can include external Markdown files in your documentation by using
reStructuredText's `.. include::` directive. For example, a common pattern is to
include your project's README in your top-level `__init__.py` like this:

`.. include:: ../README.md`

For more information, see [include Markdown
files?](https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc.html#include-markdown-files).
