    Here is an example Python program that creates 5 text files each containing
    a different boy and girl name, and stores them in a directory called
    "files".

    Remarks: 
    This program first checks if the "files" directory exists, and
    creates it if it doesn't. It then defines two lists of boy and girl names,
    and writes each name to a separate file in the "files" directory using a for
    loop and open function. The names are written using the write method of the
    file object.
    
    See also ["files/boy{}.txt".format(i+1)](../documentation/glossary.md/#str.format())
