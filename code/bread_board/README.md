- [Overview](#overview)


## Overview 

The examples in this folder use [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), a powerful AI language model, to generate Python code without any prior experience in programming. The examples are based on the Udemy class [Make Python Programs with ChatGPT with Zero Coding Skills](https://www.udemy.com/course/turn-ideas-into-python-programs-with-chatgpt/). To learn how to write good _ChatGPT_ queries that generate Python code, you need to use the class.  

The class  is divided into five sections, each of which focuses on a different aspect of using ChatGPT to build Python automations and apps. 

1. In the first section, you'll learn how to sign up for ChatGPT and install the required Python tools to execute the generated code. 
1. In the following sections, you'll dive into using ChatGPT to generate Python scripts that automate things, analyze and visualize data, and build web apps and desktop GUI apps.

This is the perfect class for anyone who wants to learn how to generate Python code using _ChatGPT_ and bring their ideas to life.
