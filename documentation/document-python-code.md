## 1. Overview 

Python documentation known as *docstring*, is use to docuement class, module, function, or method definition. 
Docstrings are accessible from the doc attribute `__doc__` for any of the Python objects and also with the **built-in help()** function. 
An object's docstring is defined by including a string constant as the first statement in the object's definition.

Docstrings help you understand the capabilities of a module or a function. For example, if you want to know more about the `sys` module, in the python interpretr do the following:
```python
    >>> import sys
    >>> help(sys)
```
For information about Python modules, see: [Python Runtime Services](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/python.html#python-runtime-services).
